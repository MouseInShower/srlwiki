### Lunarian New Year /Nongli Xinnian (农历新年)

Celebrated on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd full moon after the new year approaches (On Neodynus, Tsubaki's original planet, new year is counted when the artificial moon aligns with the planet and its star in a straight line after one orbit around its star), sometimes people celebrate them right when the local calendar hits January 1st of next year, but officially, the holiday season doesn't start till the 1st full moon approaches.

Culturally similar to Chinese New Year in terms of food preparation, decors, temples and shrine rituals, traditions in family gathering, however it has its own charm with the Tri-Beast dance.

=======

### Tri-Beast Parade / Sankemono no odori (三獣の踊)

The three divine descends of heaven: The Dragon, The Lion and The Phoenix (Fenghuang) from ancient fables. The dance is to celebrate their "retirement" from the ever lasting chaos in heaven, into a new life full of new experiences. All 3 of the dances are performed by the same group of performers. As the dances occur, there will always be bands or orchestras playing nearby or behind the performers. The performance are part of the Lunarian New Year.

On the **1st full moon**, the dragon roams around the cities, performers dressed in azure silk clothing holds up bamboo rods that props up the long, paper lantern body of the azure dragon, Dragon of Lin. Usually the size and length of a public bus or a metro train. The head performer utilizes string manipulation to make the dragon's head blink and its jaws move, or even activate the propane ignition for the dragon to spit blue fire, the gas pipe leading to the ignition is designed a way so it emits a roaring sound effect when the pressurized propane gas releases. The musical for this one utilizes instruments such as drums, flutes, and a special type of "water speaker" that emulates sounds of ocean waves. The 1st dance is always the dragon, as the dragon is the first descender. A celebration for the dragon's divine, element controlling power forming Kinyakumo, also very much a birthday gift to the Emperor Longlin.

On the **2nd full moon**, the lion waltz around the cities. The head of the lions, the golden lion, with its fur all shiny and gold-like, resembling the Lion of Gui, who is the second descender. Following the Golden Lion, are many lines of "lion cubs", often made up of locals who dress up in lion themed cosplays (masks, fictional characters, fur-suits). The Lion dance is very similar to the Chinese Lion Dance. The performers of the lion dance often utilize the lion to interact with the locals, often giving away random holiday objects as gifts, such as paper lanterns, origami, fruits or lion minted gold coins. Because the performers for the lion dance are all covered under the golden fur of the lion, the performers often carry backpacks for gifts to give away. A celebration for the selflessness and kindness of the Lion of Gui.

On the **3rd full moon**, the phoenix flies around the cities. The phoenix lantern is mostly remote controlled by the body motion capture of the head performer, utilizing military technology for mecha pilots. The head performer wears a silk robe of pink and blue gradient and a paper bird mask, as they dance a ballet that tells the story of the pheonix, utilizing smooth and elegant movements to capture the phoenix's spirits of feminine, power and hope. The other performers act as side characters. Besides the head performer, there are even amounts of side performers divided left and right, one side with pink silk robes and the other with blue silk robes. They often dance in harmony and switch positions. As the phoenix lantern flies with the performer, the locals release their own lanterns with their own wishes. A celebration for the phoenix's self-discovery whilst fighting the two opposite sides of itself, a tribute to the Phoenix of Tsubaki. Compare to the other dances, this one is more melodic and soothing.

### Shukakuki Harvest Festival (収穫季)

A festival that occurs near the end of summer till the end of fall, this festival often lasts 2 or 3 months, depending on the weather. To celebrate the harvest of crops. Locals would often set out shop fronts by nearby shrines in hopes of their crops being blessed by the local deity and would sell well. To celebrate the deity of nature and the gift of farming, local shrines would perform kagura dances in the themes of Earth forming, and or nature in general. The perfect festival to buy or stock up fruits and vegetables whilist joining the festival spirit.

=======

### Shinkon Matsuri (神魂祭り)

Shinkon translates to "souls/spirits of gods/deities". Similar to real world Halloween and Obon festival, the Shinkon Matsuri is a festival for the dead and other paranormal beings, to celebrate their mutual, friendly relationships with the locals, as well as a time for deceased ancestors to return.

It occurs right after Shukakuki Harvest Festival, based off of a legend that spirits are jealous and yearn of the bountiful fruits and vegetables that humans can have and taste, and so the spirits often manifest themselves in disguised human forms to purchase human food with fake money that turns into leaves after the spirit leaves, some spirits even straight up steal.

In order to counter these spirits' undesirable behaviors, the local shrines and temples put up offerings for the spirits to take away instead. Family households also set up small shrines with statues of the green hair green horned shinigami (god of death) and incense as well as horses, ox, donkey, chicken statues made out of various fruits and vegetables, in order for them to act as guides for the deceased ancestor to find their way into the household and celebrate the bountiful harvest together, or to ensure the family's safety from other evil spirits.

Due to the spirits being active during Shinkon Matsuri, many paranormal incidents are recorded, and it is up to the local shrine maidens and or exorcists to send them away, but really, most of the time these "incidents" were more on the locals being overly paranoid and sees everything as an action of a spirit.

Scientifically, it is stated that during Shinkon Matsuri, the activities of Quantum-Imaginary fluctuations would increase tremendously, it is also theorized that due to the holiday being a traditional thing that happens at the end of Shukakuki, people's fears could manifest via Q.I., and hence increasing the fluctations. In other words, people are so used to being afraid during Shinkon Matsuri that the spirits might as well manifest itself from said fears.

=======

### Heavenly Descendants' Nights of Peace / Anye (霄裔安夜)

A bit similar to real world Christmas, it is also celebrated around the same time as real world Christmas.

Based off of the Three Childrens and The Divine Weapon legend, where the three childrens of "heaven" (Imaginary) descended onto the mortal realm after fighting the chaos of heaven, coming to the mortal realm to live amongst the mortals, being their guides to rightousness. To celebrate their descend, no one works on the day of Anye, it is a day of relaxation.

At the Night of Peace, all electricity shuts off in order for the people to view the stars above without light pollution (Except for military, defense systems and emergency shelters, they run on back up when electricity shuts off.), and the electricity cuts back on when sun rises again. The locals prepare food before shut off time and gather together with family and or friends to watch the stars. It is also a time where people gather together to share their stories of the year before the year ends.

The day after Anye, households, shrines, temples and government buildings all go through massive clean ups, to clean and throw away the "chaos" that accumulated over the year, preparing for the new year to come.

## Fables and Legends

### Three Childrens and The Divine Weapons

When the concept of a concept was formed, so were many things. First, the sky was created, the universe itself, then, a tree was planted, the World Tree, its branches reached infinity, far and wide, then, there was life, and from life, the Imaginary was formed. The first heaven that housed many spirits, many souls and emotions, it was pure freedom, but chaotic, there was no sorts of boundary, no ideas of violence yet also no ideas of kindness. And so, a deity was borned to manage the Imaginary. And thus life is stable, free of insanity.

The deity, feeling lonely, constructed three beings, the Dragon, the Lion, and the Phoenix (Fenghuang). The Deity then asked them to watch over the World Tree, enduring its existence. But as they watched over the world, they were contaminated by emotions.

The dragon became conscious of himself, seeing the intelligence of humanity, he often thought to himself of his own intelligence, studying the power of humanity and their advancements, he came to the belief that he too, can utilize his own sentience for knowledge, and so, The Dragon seeks the ultimate wisdom.

The Lion became emotional of human kindness, she envied the close relationships of humans, and so, The Lion became despirate for a friend.

The Phoenix, fueled with injustice that humans can commit, is angered, she believes that the human emotions are a hinderance to balance, and so, The Phoenix desired destruction.

The Lion's idea conflicted with The Phoenix, and so they fought, one cling onto hope of creation, and the other, the despair of destruction. The Dragon, sees them as foolish for fighting, joined in on the war in order to end the war.

With their in fighting, the World Tree was not cared for, and thus, it collapsed, withered. With the crumbling of life, the imaginary would soon follow.

Under his breath, he commanded countless warriors under him, attacking both the Lion and the Phoenix, it was a brutal war. The Lion, focused on defense, wanting to be the pennicle of mercy, she refused to kill, however, the war was a torment itself. The dragon, effected by the phoenix's violence, became bloodthirsty. To bring upon mercy, the Lion pierced the dragon, felling him.

The Phoenix, at the critical moment, pierced the Lion, felling her after realizing what she has done, she regrets her violent outburst, with her weakened emotional state, she was overwhelmed by the revenge hungry warriors of the dragon. And she too, fell along with them. The three childrens destroyed each other due to their own uncontrollable emotions, falling from heaven into mortal realm.

The deity, disappointed, but loves her creations, erased strands of history in order to bring the World Tree back to life, however, as punishment, they were to live alongside mortals.

"Live to learn how to control your emotions," said the deity, "once you are able controlled your's, you may return to me."

The three childrens, filled with regrets, decided to accept their punishments. They walked the mortal realm, observing every aspects of life, they gathered their thoughts, and became the voices of humanity. The deity was impressed, she called for them, but they became attached to living amongst mortals, and so, the deity let them, but as a reward, they were each gifted with a divine weapon of their own, cathered to their personalities, and they were to be the weapons that protects all life.

Eventually, she found another rabbit, who is energetic and full of spirits, the rabbit of Wholeness.

Wholeness was hammering a mortar full of stars, but the stars are so bright that Wholeness could not see where she is aiming. Seeing this, Emptiness offered to help, by balling herself up, her dark fur absorbed the star's brightness, eating the light so that Wholeness could finally see. Moved by her action, Wholeness hugged Emptiness, and Wholeness's pure white fur absorbed the darkness of Emptiness, understanding her lonliness, whilist Emptiness's heart was filled by the love of Wholeness, understanding her kindness.

### The Demon of Heaven and The Angel of Hell

A demon born of hell became curious of mortals, and wanted to study why certain spirits come to hell, and thus, the demon went to live with the mortals. And there, he saw the terrible things that the mortals did to each other, he gasped, and felt sorry for the ignorant, yet feeling that they deserved the punishment in hell, however, feeling sorry of those who did not know of their sins, the demon sought to teach the mortals of the definition of sin.

Whilist in Heaven, an angel became curious of mortal limits, and wanted to see the line between sinful and pure, and so, he also went to live with the mortals. And there, he saw the kindness and empathy that mortals could have, he gasped, how could mortals be such gentle beings? and so, the angel became an ambassador of lies, with his power, he spread the lies of sinfulness.

From their actions, the heaven promoted the demon, whilist hell pulled down the angel.

In the end, they both fulfilled their desires, however, by pursuing their desires with a narrowed focus, they were no longer themselves.

### The Comforter of Death

Death is the balancer of life, they exist in harmony, however, sometimes, life feels unfair, and that death is the mercy, and sometimes, death feels unfair, and that life is the mercy.

Many are afraid of dying, afraid of losing things they love, afraid of not obtaining things they want to obtain, however, in the eyes of the deity, nothing is lost.

At the end of the tunnel, she awaits there, and with a smile, she welcomes you in a dream, a world of your memories, merged and constructed, your thoughts, your desires, she breaks them down for you. Like watching a show, you remember the memories you've gathered, the times you've spent being alive, it is you, that have constructed memories, memories of everything, and everything involved would have memories of you. Animals, people, as you remember them, they will also remember you. You are never alone, for she will always be with you, guiding you through your own memories, even in the darkness ones, she is there to comfort you.

Existing is to feel. As she holds your hands through the dark times, she reminds you that in the midst of the mud, a flower will always bloom, that flower is a life in itself, forced to bloom by insatiable will to experience the sun, the kind, fluffy bee that occationally visits, the violent storm and the freezing hail, but in the end, the flower leaves a mark of its existence, even if it is no longer alive. For the future visitors, they learn of your history, your markings on the world, from your remains, they discover everything around you, the stories that were born from your actions, the tales that would past on and on.

Don't believe that you will become forgotten, as long as you once existed, you will never be forgotten, as your existence was also seen by her, from behind the curtains of Imaginary. Even if no mortals will remember you, even if your mortal husk was entirely wiped out, your spirit will always be in the hands of her. Why worry about other mortals remembering you? When there is a deity who would.

Her name is Mohrpas, she is the Seventh lord, she will always rememeber you when no one else would. So, fear not, for as long as she exists, death will just be the beginning of the end.
