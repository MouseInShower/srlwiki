# History

## Beginning of Kinyakumo
Once upon a time, where the year of humanity is marked as "2357", humanity prayed for a savior in the midst of a seventh world war. They prayed for an angel to descend, free all from suffering. However, when the lightning struck the Azure Dragon fountain in Kiyomizu Temple located in Kyoto, Japan, instead of a savior, a large egg appeared.

The egg eventually hatched a young lady with deer like antlers, blue and red gradient eyes, described with a hint of lizardry, and patches of shiny scales that of obsidian spear heads, her scales intensified more and more towards the long, dragon like tail attached to her body at the back. The fur that runs along her spine glowed by the ends.

Many began to worship this young lady, claiming her as the savior that humanity prayed for, but for some, she could also be a demon from the depths of hell, finally coming to attack humanity while it is at its weakest states. Truth is, she is just a fallen warrior from heaven, a heaven not of any faith, a heaven that exists because the hopes and delusions of humanity, or by scientific terms at the time, the so called "Imaginary". A sort of "heaven" not well understood by many.

The Kiyomizu Temple, a refuge of war victims at the time, along with the temple's monks, took in this creature and named her Longlin, Long for her dragon like appearance, and Lin for the forest that the monks hopes to recover from the devastation of war. Even with the outcries of some groups of refugees, arguing that she is a demon who must be tossed away, the monks accepted her as their own, as part of their beliefs that "demons were not born, they were made".

With the help of the temple, and Longlin's incredible learning skills and speeds, she quickly became the smartest amongst all, with her ability to come up with strategies in the midst of chaos, her encouraging speech and her commanding voice quickly won the favors of many. She had started her own army, calling it "Kinyakumo".

Kinyakumo means "The Medicinal Eye of Gold", Longlin came up with the name in order to honor the nurses and doctors, those who overcame themselves, those who abandoned humanity, those who braved hails of war, those with a keen eye, understanding the emotions of others, all in order to save anyone they can. Longlin, like the monks of the temple, wants a more peaceful world.

And so, under her command, she quickly became recognized by more and more people, she has gained power and even faith. Many fought for her, trusting her to bring about a new future, the true symbol of hope, a general of an unfathomable army, blood spilled on many soils and once living flesh decayed away. By 2399, Longlin became the new "Emperor" of Japan. Many considered her as a masculine figure, hence the title of "Emperor".

=======

## Forming of Modern Day Kinyakumo

No freedom is without restrictions, no peace is recognized without war. Longlin, finally gotten back to her heavenly senses, possible with her dragon blood. 

Yielding her divine power, with a stomp, she split the earth, for it is her drums, beating at her intimidating march, the sound for a beautiful future. With a roar, she summoned thunder, flashes of energy overloading her enemies, for their death was instant and painless, no longer worrying. With a wave of her arm, she summoned gusts of strong winds that of hurricanes, knocking away those who inflicts pain, and soothing those who waited patiently for a cure to suffering. With the blood dripped from her wounds, she manifested them into tsunamis, washing away sins of the past. With a shine from her eyes, wildfire busted into the heart of darkness, exterminating shadows of humanity.

There is no ending, as long as she exists, the universe will keep thriving.

Lastly, with her divine spear, the Massiah, she has ended the Seventh World War. Piercing open a gate to imaginary, she has answered the lost. The deity who waits on the other side accepted everyone. She praised Longlin of her dedication, and so, the world woke up to a beautiful morning. For some, the seemingly everlasting world wars were a fever dream that ended humanity, but for others, it was real. Longlin now stands on the top of the world, for she has conquered humanity.

Under her rule, everything changed, humanity stood up, and advanced forward, walking on the bloody soil, they have achieved world peace. Kinyakumo expanded, from an army, to entirety of East Asian, now, she has the Earth, for the people, she now stands in a place respectable to a God. And under her breath, no more wars can be fought

Longlin focused on bringing knowledge to the people, advancing every technical aspects, even with the technological set backs of the world wars, Longlin brought them back, and made them even better. Eventually, humanity is able to conquer the moon, then other planets, even going as far as Neptune, but why stop there?

In the year 5555, humanity has officially conquered 7 exo-earth-like-planets along with each equipped with a Dyson Sphere[^1](Energy harnessing straight from the star of the planet). Each ruled by one nation. For those in the past, a planet size nation could be called an empire, but with the existence of Longlin, it is only part of an empire.

With the 7 planets and their rulers, they've established The Divine Guardian Council. Each planet contributes their most gifted, most talented, the planet's ultimate, and have that individual be the Divine Guardian of that planet nation. It is a position even higher than that nation's rulers, for they represent the nation as a whole and has the honor to sit by the same table as Emperor Longlin.

The Council discuss together, planning the future for humanity.

But oh, why stop at just planets? Why not go into other realms? 

=======

## Modern Day Kinyakumo

With extensive planning, the Divine Guardians desires to make a super machine, or as they called it "Second God", an artificial, clockwork God made by humanity, to solve residue problems still reside within the world and quicken advancements. Emperor Longlin has longed for a time for her to retire from throne, and wants to live carefreely as a normal citizen, and hence forward with the plan.

In order to create the Clockwork God, they want to understand Imaginary, as such, the Q.I. research started, or quantum-imaginary, a field of science and physics devoted to understanding the fabrics of reality itself.

However, during the making of this machine, it caught the attention of the deity behind the curtain, the one who watches from the realm of Imaginary, due to the research of said field tampering with Q.I., The deity, who has seen all of time, tries her best to destroy and seal up the machine with her own power, in the process, damaging herself and the machine. For many, this marks the death of the deity.

Even with the damaged mechanism, it was still able to utilize its Q.I. tampering abilities. With last of its life, it stretched out a tear in the fabrics of reality, and hence, the portal of Q.I. Singularity formed, gaining access to another realm via imaginary.

Tsubaki, the youngest, and the seventh nation, focused mainly on businesses, trades, and technological research, was chosen as the explorer of outworlder realms. Under the rule of Tsubaki Koiwa, the Queen of the Queendom, along with her newly ascended Divine Guardian, Fuyuchi Koyuki, entered the Q.I. Singularity.

=======

## Outworlder Branch - Kinyakumo-Tsubaki

After emerging from the other side of the Q.I. singularity, N.D.S.E. immediately got to work setting up a base and even mapping out an area for a palace to be constructed. After further scouting of the land, it seems like the realm they landed in already have societies and even empires. 

Koyuki acted as the ambassador with the nearby nations and empires, in attempt to establish supports and connections. Although, Koyuki is still quite cautious, however, in this foreign realm, Koyuki is cut off from her connection with the Divine Guardians, therefore she has the freedom to say anything and do anything in the outworlder realm.

With the help of universal translation implants, important figures such as those higher ups at N.D.S.E. and Koyuki are able to understand the local tongue with ease. Koiwa doesn't seems to need them, for reasons unknown, she can automatically understand the local tongue without any translations.

=======

## 1.5 Impact
Distrust began to build between the head of N.D.S.E (Vanessa) and Koyuki, over the judgement of Koiwa's actions in the past. Because of this distrust, Koiwa is afraid of an infighting, and especially afraid of Koyuki disliking her. Her overthinking and lack of communication with Koyuki eventually lead to a mental breakdown that caused the 1.5 Impact. 

Almost like the First Impact, except Koiwa's flames and explosive forces were conceited inside the palace under the core suppression mechanisms; a system which is specifically designed to suppress extreme and sudden emotions that resonates with the phoenix core and Koiwa's spiritual core at the same time, supposedly, it should prevent the same disaster as the First Impact, however, the system is still in testing and it is imperfect.

Koiwa's cores meltdown anyways, and her intense emotions forced open the Gate of Guf. Like the Q.I. Singularity, the Gate of Guf leads to the imaginary, but a dimension of imaginary that is supposedly hidden and mirrors reality, it doesn't leads to another realm, it is just a physical manifestation of one's extremely strong thoughts.

Second in Command of N.D.S.E., Remilia Haganehara, also known as "Remmy", designed a specialized unit named ATLAS: Alternate Threshold Load Algorithm Suppressor, also named after the Greek mythology titan "Atlas", who held up the celestial sphere of the world. This incredibly large, human piloted, half biological humanoid machine, held the rings of the gate, stretching them open as they were collapsing down to a point, preventing further collision meltdown of the cores and also preventing the destruction of the outworlder realm they just settled in.

With the ring stretched, the Gate of Guf is unable to close and release its potential energy, thus suspended above the palace, where the phoenix core resides, also with this, the mirror realm of the palace is attracted to the real world palace due to the cores desire to become one. However, by unexplained miracle, the mirror palace seems to only be hovering above, with no movements at all.

This sparked many fears as well as inspiration for Q.I. research across Kinyakumo. With the incident also brings certain unpleasant events.

=======

## Post 1.5 Impact

The land in which current day Kinyakumo-Tsubaki sits on in the outworlder realm, according to SSAIR (Local university) historical analysis teams, or H.A.T, the land was once a site for a civilization who vanished or was reduced rapidly due to unrecorded reasons, due to ambassador reports, a demonic entity seemed to have swept the area and caused massive reduction in population, leaving behind remnants of despair. Utilizing this report, H.A.T. concludes that the local land may have residual, unextinguished spirits that houses certain levels of force that could only be described as "magic".

The opening Gate of Guf seems to have an ongoing conflict with said local spirits, causing unexplained havoc such as sudden sickness, massive energy fluctuation and unstable energy entropy.

In response, Kinyakumo has cut ties with neighboring nation; Neo Kirameku, with the conclusion that the local spirits who belongs to the ancestor of Neo Kirameku's ruler are causing havoc due to conflicts with Q.I., in fear of any "magical" interactions that could intensify the havoc.

By isolating away from effects of this type of "magic", specifically sourced from Kirameku, Kinyakumo has closed its borders at Neo Kirameku, with any who moved into Kinyakumo from Neo Kirameku to be escorted by the K.P.D.- Kinyakumo Police Deparment. As well as local historical remnants extinguished by the Divine Spear of Tsubaki, controlled by the Queen Tsubaki Koiwa.

During this event, the K.P.D and N.D.S.E. received technological and medical aid from a neighboring empire called The Grand Yosokoan Empire, ruled under the reign of Nazorious.

## Holidays

### Lunarian New Year /Nongli Xinnian (农历新年)

Celebrated on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd full moon after the new year approaches, sometimes people celebrate them right when the local calendar hits January 1st of next year, but officially, the holiday season doesn't start till the 1st full moon approaches.

Culturally similar to Chinese New Year in terms of food preparation, decors, temples and shrine rituals, traditions in family gathering, however it has its own charm with the Tri-Beast dance.

=======

### Tri-Beast Parade / Sankemono no odori (三獣の踊)

The three divine descends of heaven: The Dragon, The Lion and The Phoenix (Fenghuang) from ancient fables. The dance is to celebrate their "retirement" from the ever lasting chaos in heaven, into a new life full of new experiences. All 3 of the dances are performed by the same group of performers. As the dances occur, there will always be bands or orchestras playing nearby or behind the performers.

On the **1st full moon**, the dragon roams around the cities, performers dressed in azure silk clothing holds up bamboo rods that props up the long, paper lantern body of the azure dragon, Dragon of Lin. Usually the size and length of a public bus or a metro train. The head performer utilizes string manipulation to make the dragon's head blink and its jaws move, or even activate the propane ignition for the dragon to spit blue fire, the gas pipe leading to the ignition is designed a way so it emits a roaring sound effect when the pressurized propane gas releases. The musical for this one utilizes instruments such as drums, flutes, and a special type of "water speaker" that emulates sounds of ocean waves. The 1st dance is always the dragon, as the dragon is the first descender. A celebration for the dragon's divine, element controlling power forming Kinyakumo, also very much a birthday gift to the Emperor Longlin.

On the **2nd full moon**, the lion waltz around the cities. The head of the lions, the golden lion, with its fur all shiny and gold-like, resembling the Lion of Gui, who is the second descender. Following the Golden Lion, are many lines of "lion cubs", often made up of locals who dress up in lion themed cosplays (masks, fictional characters, fur-suits). The Lion dance is very similar to the Chinese Lion Dance. The performers of the lion dance often utilize the lion to interact with the locals, often giving away random holiday objects as gifts, such as paper lanterns, origami, fruits or lion minted gold coins. Because the performers for the lion dance are all covered under the golden fur of the lion, the performers often carry backpacks for gifts to give away. A celebration for the selflessness and kindness of the Lion of Gui.

On the **3rd full moon**, the phoenix flies around the cities. The phoenix lantern is mostly remote controlled by the body motion capture of the head performer, utilizing military technology for mecha pilots. The head performer wears a silk robe of pink and blue gradient and a paper bird mask, as they dance a ballet that tells the story of the pheonix, utilizing smooth and elegant movements to capture the phoenix's spirits of feminine, power and hope. The other performers act as side characters. Besides the head performer, there are even amounts of side performers divided left and right, one side with pink silk robes and the other with blue silk robes. They often dance in harmony and switch positions. As the phoenix lantern flies with the performer, the locals release their own lanterns with their own wishes. A celebration for the phoenix's self-discovery whilst fighting the two opposite sides of itself, a tribute to the Phoenix of Tsubaki. Compare to the other dances, this one is more melodic and soothing.
